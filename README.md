# Microservices Blog Project

This project is a blog application built using a microservices architecture, leveraging Spring Security and various technologies to ensure robust and scalable functionality. The application is composed of seven distinct services:

- **user-service**: Manages user data and authentication.
- **auth-service**: Handles security with JWT and stores tokens in MongoDB.
- **email-service**: Sends email notifications, including user registration confirmation, using Kafka.
- **post-service**: Manages blog posts.
- **discovery-service**: Uses Eureka for service discovery.
- **config-service**: Manages configuration settings pulled from GitHub.
- **api-gateway**: Acts as the entry point for all client requests, routing them to the appropriate services.

## Key Features

- **JWT Authentication**: Utilizes JWT for secure user authentication, with tokens managed and stored in MongoDB.
- **Email Confirmation**: Employs Kafka to handle email notifications for user registration.
- **Service Discovery**: Eureka-server is used for dynamic service discovery.
- **Centralized Configuration**: Configurations are centrally managed in the config-server, which retrieves settings from GitHub.
- **Microservices Architecture**: Modular design using microservices for scalability and maintainability.


## Technologies Used

- **Spring Security**: For securing the services and managing JWT authentication.
- **MongoDB**: Used for storing tokens and user data.
- **Kafka**: For handling email notifications.
- **Eureka**: For service discovery.
- **GitHub**: For storing and retrieving configuration settings.
- **Spring Boot**: For building and running the microservices.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git

2. Set Up the Infrastructure**

   ```bash
   # Navigate to the infra-setup directory
   cd infra-setup

   # Start the services using Docker Compose
   docker-compose up

3. **Run the services in this order

1. config-server
2. discovery-service
3. security-service
4. user-service
5. post-service
6. email-service
5. api-gateway
